    <p>My interest outside of web development goes back to being a child playing a PS2 to understanding to connect the tv and power; I also went to audio engineering school, you know the people on the console recording artists who're in the soundproof room. Through engineering, working with the artist, and video games needing teamwork, I learned a willingness to work with others as well as led me to be interested in technology and web development in general.</p>
